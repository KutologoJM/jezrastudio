                                    Hello there. I'm Kutologo J. Mashego.
                                    An aspiring Django backend developer and I'd like to tell you a bit about myself and
                                    why I'm
                                    on this journey.

                                <p>
                                    I wish to become a software engineer so that I may gain the skills and expertise
                                    needed to
                                    be able to turn any
                                    ideas I have into reality, whether it be a simple weather widget for my site or
                                    programming
                                    the logic for a recreation
                                    of the blackjack card game.

                                    Programming is my form of creative expression. My way of allowing my ideas to come
                                    to life
                                    through experimentation
                                    and perseverance. I find joy in learning about how machines, animals, structures or
                                    anything
                                    within my interests
                                    works and using that to develop something I can interact with.

                                    I currently have Python as my programming language of choice, it was easy to pick up
                                    and
                                    works well with
                                    my affinity for fast prototyping and my 'build as you break' mentality. I was mostly
                                    command
                                    line based while
                                    learning python but transitioned into using Django once I saw my ideas could benefit
                                    from
                                    having a solid GUI.
                                    <br>
                                    I prefer Tailwind css for my styling. I use Nuxt for building dedicated front-ends
                                    like this
                                    webpage but I am still
                                    quite new to it, but I'm enjoying the learning experience. My knowledge with
                                    Javascript is
                                    at the level of a novice syntax wise,
                                    however conceptually I can operate at the same level as my Python abilities which I
                                    consider
                                    to be Intermediate.

                                    I am self-taught primarily through trial and error, online tutorials and some short
                                    courses.
                                    I learnt html, css
                                    and Javascript in high-school as part of Computer Applications Technology.

                                    I am a high-school graduate. I attended Hoërskool Sybrand van Niekerk in Sabie,
                                    Mpumalanga
                                    S.A. where I obtained
                                    a bachelor's pass for my NSC matriculation.
